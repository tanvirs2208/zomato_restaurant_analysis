## Conclusion
- India is the primary market for Zomato, with a need to focus on cities with the lowest ratings to improve user experience. 
- Additionally, only 12% of users utilize table booking, which could be due to a preference for visiting restaurants directly or a potentially complicated booking process. Optimizing the table booking feature could help increase its usage.
- Moreover, expanding Zomato's presence in international markets could provide significant growth opportunities and diversify its user base.
